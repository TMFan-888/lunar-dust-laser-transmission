# Lunar Dust Laser Transmission

This project simulates and analyzes laser transmission through lunar dust environments, considering both illuminated and shadow areas.

## Features
- Calculation of extinction coefficients for lunar dust
- Analysis of laser transmission in both illuminated and shadow areas
- Power harvesting calculations at different heights
- Consideration of inclined transmission paths

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2019b or later
- Signal Processing Toolbox
- Optional: Parallel Computing Toolbox

## Usage
1. Open MATLAB
2. Navigate to the `src` directory
3. Run `main.m`

## Results
The program generates several figures showing:
- Extinction coefficient relationships
- Dust transmission characteristics
- Power harvesting capabilities
